# MERGE SORT LECTURE
## Author: Cory Henderson

## Learning Objectives
- To understand how the merge sort algorithm works
- Learn to properly apply the merge sort algorithm to an array

## Background
- Merge sort is a sorting algorithm which uses the idea of "divide and conquer" to quickly sort data sets in the form of an array. 
- The basic idea is to break down a data set into halves (subsets), until each subset is only 1 value in length. Each midpoint should be considered as n/2 floored, where n is the length of the data set.
- Once all subsets are broken down to 1 in length, they can be sorted two at a time and merged back together.
- When merging back together, start with the beginning value of each pair of subsets. Parse through each array while comparing values and recreating a new sorted array.
