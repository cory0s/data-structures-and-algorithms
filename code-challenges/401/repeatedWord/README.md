# First repeated word
This challenge creates a function which finds a repeated word in a string.

## Challenge
- Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used a hash table to put words into. If the word already exists, it should be found in the hash table and an alert can be made.

Space: O(1)
Time: O(1)
