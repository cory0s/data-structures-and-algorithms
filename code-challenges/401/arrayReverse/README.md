# Reverse an Array
This is the first code challenge for JS401.  It requires creation of a function called reverseArray.

## Challenge
This challenge asks to write a function which takes in an array of elements, and returns an array of equal length, with all elements in reverse order.

## Approach and Efficiency
My approach involved creating an empty array and adding elements of the input array to the new array starting at the inut array's end.  Big O space/time is O(n).
