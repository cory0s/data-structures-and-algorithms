# Depth First Traversal
This challenge creates a function which conducts a depth first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach involved recursively calling a search for vertex neighbors.
Time efficiency: O(n)
Space efficiency: O(n)
