# Stacks and Queues
This application creates 3 classes - a node class, stack class, and queue class to implement working stacks and queues.

## Challenge
This challenge requires creation of a stack and queue class a variety of methods:
- Both classes have a peek method which return the value of the top/front node.
- The stack has pop/push methods to add or remove nodes from the stack.
- The queue has enqueque and dequeue methods to add or remove nodes from the queue.
- Appropriate testing will be performed by jest to ensure proper functionality.

## Approach & Efficiency

## API
- pop(): removes the top value from a stack.
- push(val): adds a new node with value = val to the top of a stack.
- peek(): returns the value from the top/front of a stack or queue.
- enqueque(val): adds a node with value = val to the end of a queue.
- dequeue(): removes the front node from the queue.
